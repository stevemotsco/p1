# Project1 created by Steve Motsco and initially posted to GitHub at 1855CDT, 16Sep14

# Project URL:  http://p1.stevemotsco.me/

# Multiple problems forced me to drop, recreate, and rename the GitHub repository 
# Multiple issues with getting p1 sub-directory working even though I had no problem with hello-world sub-directory.  Had to rework things in Digital Ocean several times after discovering that I had named my repository, and thus folder in Digital Ocean, Project1 instead of p1.
# I did not have time this week to spend a lot of time developing my own css so I used one called “Black White” at http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/templates.html#.VBurDZRdWK8 which can be viewed at “http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/templates.html#.VBurDZRdWK8”.
